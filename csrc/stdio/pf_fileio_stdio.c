/* Shrink the file FILE to NEWSIZE.  Return non-FALSE on error.
 *
 * There's no direct way to do this in ANSI C.  The closest thing we
 * have is freopen(3), which truncates a file to zero length if we use
 * "w+b" as mode argument.  So we do this:
 *
 *   1. copy original content to temporary file
 *   2. re-open and truncate FILE
 *   3. copy the temporary file to FILE
 *
 * Unfortunately, "w+b" may not be the same mode as the original mode
 * of FILE.  I don't see a away to avoid this, though.
 *
 * We call freopen with NULL as path argument, because we don't know
 * the actual file-name.  It seems that the trick with path=NULL is
 * not part of C89 but it's in C99. It does not work on NetBSD though.
