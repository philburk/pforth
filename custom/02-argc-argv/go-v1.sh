# Compile pForth with custom code and show that this works. 
# We assume a posix shell and system (but adaption should be easy to others).
# This improved version only compiles the custom code defined in CF_SOURCES.
# Warning: This patches the existing source tree and might create confusion when not used on separate Git branch in case an error occurs.
# Tested on MSYS2-Cygwin, Linux, FreeBSD (X86_64 architecture each), NetBSD (i386 architecture)

# copy demo sources. Thus we do not need to change the make file.
